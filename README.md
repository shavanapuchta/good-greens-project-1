# Good Greens Project #1



## Description

- We are creating an app that allows users to find vegan and vegetarian restaurants near them.




User Story:
As a vegan or vegetarian
I want a site with local vegan menu suggestions
So I can quickly find restaurants I can eat at 

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN user is vegan or vegetarian
WHEN they input their location and dietary restrictions
THEN the site will provide a list of restaurants, menus, and addresses


### Usage:

- Our site provides place search, which returns a list of places based on a userâ€™s location or search string.
Query Autocomplete provides a query service for text-based geographic searches, returning suggested queries as users type. 

- Place Photos provides access to MILLIONS AND MILLIONS of place related photos. You know which ones I am talking about. Yelp you cannot handle this vegan jelly.
